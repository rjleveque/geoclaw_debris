Functions for tracking particles or debris in a velocity field specified
by a set of fgout frames.

Note: The functions clawpack.geoclaw.fgout_tools.make_fgout_fcn_xy and
clawpack.geoclaw.fgout_tools.make_fgout_fcn_xyt are used
to create functions used to interpolate the fluid velocity u,v
from fgout frames to particle locations.

These are experimental tools that are still under development.

    """
    For each dbno in dbnos: debris_paths[dbno] is a 2D array and it is assumed
    that the last row has the form [t1, x1, y1, u1, v1] with the location and
    velocity of this debris particle at time t1, which should equal fgout1.t.
    
    fgout1 and fgout2 should be two time frames of fgout data, each of class
    fgout_tools.FGoutFrame.  
    
    Compute the location and velocity of the debris particle at time fgout2.t,
    and append [t2, x2, y2, u2, v2] to the bottom of debris_paths[dbno].
    
    coordinate_system = 1 if (x,y) are in meters, 
                        2 if (x,y) are degrees longitude, latitude
    The velocities (u,v) are always in m/s.
    
    drag_factor, grounding_depth, and grounding_speed
    can be single values applying to all particles, or dictionaries with
    keys given by the elements of dbnos.
    
    If drag_factor[dbno]==None, grounding_depth[dbno]==0, and 
    grounding_speed[dbno]==0, then the debris particles passively advect
    with the fluid velocity.
    
    This is currently implemented using the 2-step explicit Runge-Kutta method:
    1. Interpolate fgout1.u and fgout1.v to (x1,y1) and move the particle
    over time dt/2 with this velocity, to obtain (xm,ym).
    2. Interpolate (u,v) in space and time to this midpoint location, and then
    use this velocity to move the particle over time dt from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
    
    If grounding_depth[dbno] > 0 and/or grounding_speed > 0,
    then the particle is assumed to be grounded
    whenever the local fluid depth h < grounding_depth[dbno]
    or the speed s < grounding_speed, where h and s are
    interpolated first to (x1,y1) and then to (xm,ym).
    
    If drag_factor[dbno] > 0, then the particle velocity (ud,vd)
    relaxes toward the fluid velocity (u,v) by approximately solving the ODEs
      d/dt ud = C * (u-ud)
      d/dt vd = C * (v-vd)
    where C = drag_factor[dbno]*sqrt((u-ud)**2 + (v-vd)**2)
    We approximate this by setting C to value at the current time, yielding
    exponential decay of (ud,vd) toward (u,v) with rate C over each time step.
    
    Still to add: Static and dynamic bottom friction, so that if the fluid depth
    is less than grounding_depth[dbno], the particle could still be dragged.
