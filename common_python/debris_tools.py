Note: The functions clawpack.geoclaw.fgout_tools.make_fgout_fcn_xy and
clawpack.geoclaw.fgout_tools.make_fgout_fcn_xyt are used

    that the last row has the form [t1, x1, y1, u1, v1] with the location and
    velocity of this debris particle at time t1, which should equal fgout1.t.
    
    fgout1 and fgout2 should be two time frames of fgout data, each of class
    fgout_tools.FGoutFrame.  
    
    Compute the location and velocity of the debris particle at time fgout2.t,

    The velocities (u,v) are always in m/s.
    
    drag_factor and grounding_depth can be single values applying to all
    particles, or dictionaries with keys given by the elements of dbnos.
    
    If drag_factor[dbno]==None and grounding_depth[dbno]==0, then we passively
    advect the debris particle with the fluid velocity.  This is
    currently implemented using the 2-step explicit Runge-Kutta method:
    1. Interpolate fgout1.u and fgout1.v to (x1,y1) and move the particle
    over time dt/2 with this velocity, to obtain (xm,ym).
    2. Interpolate (u,v) in space and time to this midpoint location, and then
    use this velocity to move the particle over time dt from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
    
    If grounding_depth[dbno] > 0 then the particle is assumed to be grounded
    whenever the local fluid depth h < grounding_depth[dbno], where h
    is interpolated first to (x1,y1) and then to (xm,ym).
